# Vera-Py-Service

## Development Environment Configuration
The Service application makes use of several environment variables to run, you'll need to add and configure the following environment variables:

```env
WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:4000/websocket
TOKEN={ your plugboard token }
```
This will serve as a starting point for your own environment variables. Feel free to change the values to suit your needs.
